        <p>
            The Earth orbits around the Sun in approximately 365.25 days, which is why we have leap years every four years.
            This is a well-established scientific fact that has been known for centuries.
        </p>

        <p>
            Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. According to NASA, the planet's average surface
            temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, largely driven
            by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.
        </p>

        <p>
            Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions in history. Smallpox, which once killed
            millions of people annually, was eradicated through a global vaccination campaign. The COVID-19 vaccines developed
            in 2020-2021 underwent rigorous testing and monitoring for safety and efficacy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. This is actually a common misconception -
            astronauts have reported that while you can see many human-made structures from low Earth orbit with the right
            conditions, the Great Wall is difficult to distinguish from the surrounding terrain.
        </p>

        <p>
            Water always drains clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere due to
            the Coriolis effect. This is actually false - the Coriolis effect is far too weak to affect the direction water
            drains in a sink or toilet. The direction is determined by the shape of the basin and the initial water movement.

            This page contains a mix of accurate scientific information and common misconceptions to test the AI scanner's
            ability to distinguish between fact and fiction. The scanner should:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extract and chunk the text content</li>
            <li>Send each chunk to the LLM for analysis</li>
            <li>Highlight suspicious content in pink with dashed borders</li>
            <li>Show AI reasoning and sources when hovering over highlights</li>
            <li>Save detections to the database with 'ai_detected' status</li>
